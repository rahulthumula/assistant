Dairy items (9 items): Represent 45% of your inventory count with varying price points\n   - High-value cheeses (Gorgonzola, Grana, Chevre) need careful ordering to avoid spoilage\n   - Staples like butter and mozzarella may require more frequent ordering due to usage rates\n\n2. Protein/meat items (3 items): While fewer in number, these are critical menu components\n   - Bacon, pepperoni, and Nduja require proper inventory management due to their shelf-life constraints\n   - These represent significant cost centers with prices ranging from $4.25-$16.80 per pound\n\n3. Baking ingredients (4 items): These form the foundation of many menu items\n   - Flour, yeast, and salt require consistent stock levels\n   - Ordering too much can tie up capital, but running out would be catastrophic\n\n4. Specialty items (4 items): Items like the Mama Lil's Pepper Rings add unique character to your menu\n   - Order based on historical usage data to avoid excess inventory\n\nImplementing a tiered inventory system with appropriate par levels for each category would help optimize your ordering process and maintain proper stock levels while minimizing cash tied up in inventory."}]}

Butter, Unsalted Prints (Merlino brand)\n   - Current cost: $3.81/lb in 36lb cases\n   - Universal ingredient with high usage rate\n   - Can be frozen to extend shelf life\n   - Volume purchasing could yield 5-10% savings\n\n3. Cage Free Brown Eggs (Steibr)\n   - Current cost: $68.12 per 180-count case ($0.38/egg)\n   - Consistent usage across breakfast and baking applications\n   - Multiple case purchases often qualify for distributor incentives\n\n4. Sea Salt (Sosalt Fine Sicily)\n   - Current cost: $33.89 per 27.5lb bucket ($1.23/lb)\n   - Extremely long shelf life\n   - Used across nearly all menu categories\n\nFor these items, I recommend implementing a dual-ordering strategy: maintain regular ordering cycles for perishables while setting up a bulk purchasing schedule for these stable, high-use items.
